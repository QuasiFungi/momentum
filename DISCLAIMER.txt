DISCLAIMER
---
freesfx.co.uk doesn't allow hosting their content on other platforms
I've replaced all their audio clips, that I used in this project, with placeholders (I'm sorry it was too tempting)
Download the original clips from their website and replace them here yourself
You'll have to create an account though
It's free, and doesn't charge or require credit card info etc
Or, if you want, use audio from a different source altogether
