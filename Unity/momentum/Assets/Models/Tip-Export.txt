Preparing an Object for Export into Unity:
1. It's easier to have a Collection per Object type
2. Prepend all of the Object's parts with "collectionName_", for consistency
3. Select all the finished Objects
4. Press Alt+G to reset their Origins to the World Center
5. In Object Mode
6. Rotate by 90 on X axis
7. Enter Edit Mode
8. Eotate by -90 on X axis
9. Export selected Mesh/Armature as FBX
10. Name the file same as the Collection

Notes:
- Do the same X Rotations for the Armature
- Leave all Bones with the default Rotation/Position unless doing so for Animation
- Make sure the Object Origin is same as the Bone Origin
- This does not fix the Object's Scale which is still broken...
