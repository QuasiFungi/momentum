Animating an Object in Unity:
1. In Unity
2. Select the Armature Object
3. Open the "Animation" Window
4. Click the "Create" Button
5. Navigate to the Folder that will store all Animations
6. Name the Animation Clip file "objectName-animationName", for consistency, and Save
7. Add in the Animation "Keyframes" by your preferred method
You can enable Recording, and move things around and over the timeline
Or add each Keyframe manually
8. Create as many Animation "Clips" as needed
9. For Animation Clips that should Play once then Stop, Disable the "Loop Time" property
10. Open the "Animator" Window
11. Select the Armature Object
12. Drag all Animation Clips you created for this object into this window to "Import" them
13. Create State Transitions as needed
14. For Objects that don't Animate on Game Start,
Create a new Empty State
Rename it to Idle
Set it as Default State
Add a Transition to the next State

Optional (for Mirrored Animations):
1. In the Animator Window
2. Make a duplicate of the Animation Clip
Rename it
3. Set the "Playback Speed" to -1

Alternate (for Animations with Physics Collisions):
1. Make sure each part to be Animated is a separate Object Mesh
And has only one Armature for all Objects
Bones should have one Root, and one or more children
2. In Unity
3. Add a Primitive Collider such as the Box Collider to each Animated Bone
Adjust the Collider's dimensions as needed
